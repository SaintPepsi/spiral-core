# ðŸ”§ Fixable Issues Auto-Fix System Plan

## Overview

A command-driven system that automatically fixes tracked issues through the self-update pipeline.

## Proposed Command

```
!spiral fix issues
```

## How It Would Work

### 1. Issue Collection Phase

- Query `FixableIssueTracker` for all pending issues
- Group by category and severity
- Present summary to user

### 2. Fix Generation Phase

For each issue:

- Generate appropriate fix based on issue category
- Use Claude Code agents specialized for each type:
  - `message-size-reducer.md` - For Discord message length issues
  - `compilation-fixer.md` - For build errors
  - `test-failure-analyzer.md` - For failing tests
  - `formatting-fixer.md` - For style issues

### 3. Validation Phase

- Run two-phase validation pipeline
- Ensure fixes don't introduce new issues
- Rollback capability if fixes fail

### 4. Application Phase

- Commit validated fixes
- Push to repository
- Mark issues as resolved in tracker

## Implementation Requirements

### New Command Handler

```rust
pub struct FixIssuesCommand {
    tracker: Arc<FixableIssueTracker>,
    executor: Arc<UpdateExecutor>,
}
```

### Issue Categories Supported

1. **Message Too Large** (Priority: High)

   - Automatically refactor long help messages
   - Split into multiple messages or pagination
   - Example: The help command that triggered this plan

2. **Compilation Warnings** (Priority: Medium)

   - Fix unused variables
   - Resolve type mismatches
   - Update deprecated API usage

3. **Test Failures** (Priority: High)

   - Update test expectations
   - Fix logic errors
   - Handle edge cases

4. **Formatting Issues** (Priority: Low)

   - Auto-run `cargo fmt`
   - Fix linting issues
   - Standardize code style

5. **Documentation Issues** (Priority: Low)
   - Fix broken links
   - Update outdated examples
   - Add missing documentation

## Safety Mechanisms

1. **Issue Prioritization**

   - Fix high-severity issues first
   - Group related issues together
   - Limit fixes per run (max 10)

2. **Human Approval**

   - Show proposed fixes before applying
   - Allow selective fix application
   - Require approval for breaking changes

3. **Rollback Support**
   - Git snapshot before fixes
   - Individual fix rollback
   - Full rollback on critical failure

## Command Flow

```
User: !spiral fix issues

Bot: ðŸ“Š Found 3 fixable issues:
     â€¢ [HIGH] Discord message too large in help.rs
     â€¢ [MED] Unused variable in main.rs
     â€¢ [LOW] Missing docs in api.rs

     Apply fixes? (yes/no/select)

User: yes

Bot: ðŸ”§ Generating fixes...
     âœ… Fixed message size issue
     âœ… Removed unused variable
     âœ… Added documentation

     ðŸ§ª Running validation...
     âœ… All tests passing
     âœ… No new issues introduced

     ðŸ“¦ Committing fixes...
     âœ… Pushed to repository

     3 issues resolved!
```

## Benefits

1. **Proactive Maintenance** - Issues fixed before they accumulate
2. **Learning System** - Tracks patterns of common issues
3. **Reduced Manual Work** - Automated fix generation and testing
4. **Quality Improvement** - Continuous code quality enhancement

## Integration Points

- **FixableIssueTracker** - Source of issues to fix
- **UpdateExecutor** - Orchestrates fix application
- **ValidationPipeline** - Ensures fix quality
- **Claude Code Agents** - Generate appropriate fixes
- **Git Operations** - Commit and push fixes

## Future Enhancements

1. **Scheduled Fixes** - Run automatically on schedule
2. **Fix Patterns Library** - Reusable fix templates
3. **Machine Learning** - Learn from successful fixes
4. **Cross-Repository** - Fix issues in dependencies
5. **Performance Optimization** - Auto-fix performance issues

## Risk Assessment

- **Risk Level**: 3 (Fibonacci scale)
- **Complexity**: 5 (Fibonacci scale)
- **Risk Factors**:
  - Automated code changes could introduce bugs
  - Fix conflicts between multiple issues
  - Potential for fix loops if fixes create new issues

## Implementation Priority

This is a **Medium Priority** enhancement that would significantly improve system maintainability. Should be implemented after core self-update system is battle-tested.
