}
```

#### 🔧 Code Quality Assessment

- [ ] Error messages are helpful but not revealing
- [ ] Proper error propagation
- [ ] No silent failures

**Performance Considerations**:

```rust
// Example performance concern:
for item in large_vec.iter() {

}
```

#### 🧪 Testing Analysis

**Test Coverage**:

- [ ] Unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Integration tests for external interactions

    assert_eq!(result, "expected output");  // ✅ Clear test case
}
```

// 🧠 CONCURRENCY DECISION: Using Arc<RwLock> instead of Arc<Mutex>
// Why: Read-heavy workload (agent lookups) benefits from concurrent reads
// Alternative: Arc<Mutex> (rejected: unnecessary write blocking for reads)
// Audit: Verify no deadlock potential in execute_task method

// ❌ Missing example:
let agents = Arc::new(RwLock::new(HashMap::new())); // No reasoning provided
```

**3-Strikes Abstraction Analysis**:

- [ ] No duplicated code patterns (if pattern appears 3+ times, should be extracted)
- [ ] Utilities properly extracted and reused
- [ ] Inline code appropriately kept for single/double use

**Contextual Proximity Score**: [1-10]

**Proximity Improvements Needed**:

1. [Specific area lacking decision archaeology]
2. [Missing audit checkpoint location]
3. [Abstraction opportunity or over-abstraction issue]

#### 🎯 Decision Archaeology

**Why These Choices**:

```rust
// Example decision analysis:
impl Clone for DataProcessor {  // ❓ Why Clone instead of Arc?
    fn clone(&self) -> Self {
        // Analysis: This might be unnecessary copying
    }
}
```

**Alternative Approaches**:

fn process_all_items(items: &[Item]) -> Vec<Result> {
    items.iter()
        .map(|item| expensive_computation(item))  // ⚠️ Potential bottleneck
        .collect()
}
```

**Optimization Opportunities**:

1. [Specific optimization with expected impact]
2. [Alternative algorithm or data structure]

**Performance Testing Needed**:

- [ ] Benchmark with realistic data sizes

## Quick Reference: Red Flags in AI-Generated Code

### 🚨 Immediate Concerns

```rust
// Security red flags:
let query = format!("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {}", user_id);  // ❌ SQL injection
let password = "hardcoded_password";  // ❌ Hardcoded secrets
let _ = potentially_failing_operation();  // ❌ Ignored errors

// Performance red flags:
for i in 0..1000000 {  // ❌ Excessive loops without justification
    vec.push(expensive_computation());
}

// Maintenance red flags:
pub fn do_everything(param1: String, param2: String, param3: String,
                    param4: String, param5: String) {  // ❌ Too many parameters
    // ... 500 lines of code ...  // ❌ Function too long
}

// Aggressive Proximity red flags:
impl ComplexSystem {  // ❌ No decision reasoning for design choices
    fn critical_method(&self) -> Result<()> {  // ❌ No audit checkpoint
        // Complex logic without explanation
        self.dangerous_operation()?;  // ❌ No reasoning for approach
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

### ✅ Good Patterns to Recognize

```rust
// Security good patterns:
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub struct SanitizedInput {  // ✅ Type safety
    inner: String,
}

impl SanitizedInput {
    pub fn new(input: &str) -> Result<Self, ValidationError> {  // ✅ Validated construction
        validate_input(input)?;
        Ok(Self { inner: input.to_string() })
    }
}

// Performance good patterns:
use std::sync::Arc;
let shared_data = Arc::new(expensive_to_clone_data);  // ✅ Efficient sharing

// Maintainability good patterns:
/// Processes user authentication requests
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `credentials` - User credentials to validate
///
/// # Returns
/// * `Ok(token)` - Authentication successful, returns JWT token
/// * `Err(AuthError)` - Authentication failed with specific error
pub fn authenticate_user(credentials: LoginCredentials) -> Result<JwtToken, AuthError> {
    // ✅ Clear documentation, specific types, proper error handling
}

// Aggressive Proximity good patterns:
impl SecuritySystem {
    /// 🛡️ AUTHENTICATION AUDIT CHECKPOINT: Primary security validation
    /// DECISION: JWT tokens over session cookies for stateless scaling
    /// Why: Enables horizontal scaling without session store dependencies
    /// Alternative: Session cookies (rejected: requires shared session storage)
    /// Audit: Verify token signature validation and expiry checking
    fn authenticate_user(&self, token: &str) -> Result<UserId> {
        // 🔍 TOKEN VALIDATION: Critical security boundary
        // Why inline: Security logic must be immediately visible for audit
        if token.len() < MIN_TOKEN_LENGTH {  // 📝 32 chars min: prevents brute force
            return Err(AuthError::InvalidToken);
        }
        // ✅ Excellent: Decision reasoning, audit markers, inline explanations
    }
}
```
