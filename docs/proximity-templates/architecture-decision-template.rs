// üìã ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENTATION TEMPLATE
// Include in module-level documentation:

/// # Architecture Decision Records
/// 
/// ## ADR-001: Component Registry Pattern
/// **Decision**: Use HashMap-based component registry with Arc<RwLock<>>
/// **Reasoning**: [Detailed reasoning]
/// **Alternatives Considered**: [What was rejected]
/// **Consequences**: [Positive and negative consequences]
/// 
/// ## ADR-002: Coordination Mechanism
/// **Decision**: [Coordination choice]
/// **Reasoning**: [Detailed reasoning]
/// **Alternatives Considered**: [What was rejected]
/// **Consequences**: [Positive and negative consequences]

// Pattern Notes for Architecture Decisions:
// 1. Document major architectural choices with comprehensive reasoning
// 2. Include alternatives considered and why they were rejected
// 3. Specify audit points to verify architecture is working
// 4. Test architectural invariants, not just individual functions
// 5. Consider performance implications and document trade-offs
// 6. Plan for scale - how does this architecture grow?
// 7. Document coordination patterns to prevent deadlocks
// 8. Include health monitoring as part of architecture
// 9. Maintain Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for major choices
