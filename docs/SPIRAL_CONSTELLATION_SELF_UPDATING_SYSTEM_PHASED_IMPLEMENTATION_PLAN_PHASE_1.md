## Phase 1: Core Self-Updating Foundation Philosophy

### Goals

- Establish reliable self-update pipeline
- Prove safety mechanisms work
- Build operational confidence
- Collect baseline performance data

### 1.1 Trigger Conditions

### Authorised Activation

- **Who**: Pre-defined authorised users only
- **How**: Explicit update requests from authorised users
- **Alternative**: Automated fix triggers for specific scenarios

### Unauthorised Access Handling

- **Response**: Contextual rejection with thematic messaging
- **Action**: Deny request and provide appropriate response

### 1.2 Pre-flight Checks

### System State Validation

- Verify system isn't currently in update mode
- Check if update queue has available slots
- Ensure system has booted without errors
- Validate all current tests are passing

### Resource Availability

- Confirm sufficient resources for operations
- Verify memory and storage constraints
- Check external service connectivity
- Ensure core system connection is stable

### Information Gathering

- Determine if additional information is needed from requesting user
- If insufficient information: Request specifics from user
- **Restart Process**: Restart the entire process with complete information

### 1.3 Planning & Analysis Phase

### Request Analysis

- **Scope Assessment**: Analyse the complexity and scope of the requested changes
- **Impact Evaluation**: Identify which system components will be affected
- **Dependency Mapping**: Determine what systems depend on areas being modified
- **Risk Classification**: Categorise the request by risk level

### Task Decomposition

- **Break Down Request**: Decompose the user request into specific, actionable tasks
- **Sequence Planning**: Determine the optimal order for implementing changes
- **Validation Strategy**: Plan specific tests and validation steps for each task
- **Rollback Planning**: Identify rollback points and recovery strategies for each phase

### Technical Planning

- **Component Identification**: List all components that need to be modified, created, or removed
- **Integration Points**: Map how changes will integrate with existing system components
- **Testing Requirements**: Define specific tests needed to validate each change

### Resource Planning

- **Time Estimation**: Estimate completion time for each task component
- **Complexity Assessment**: Rate complexity of proposed changes
- **Prerequisite Identification**: Determine if any prerequisites or setup is needed
- **Constraint Analysis**: Identify any technical constraints or limitations

### Agent Assignment Strategy

- **Task Distribution**: Determine which agents are best suited for each task
- **Agent Coordination**: Plan how different agents will work together
- **Validation Chain**: Define the sequence of validation agents
- **Quality Gates**: Establish checkpoints where agent approval is required

### Communication Plan

- **Progress Reporting**: Define how progress will be communicated to the user
- **Milestone Messaging**: Plan key milestone messages and status updates
- **Error Communication**: Prepare communication strategy for potential issues
- **Success Metrics**: Define how success will be measured and reported

### Planning Output

Before proceeding to implementation, the system must generate:

1. **Detailed Task List**: Numbered list of specific tasks to be completed
2. **Implementation Sequence**: Ordered sequence with dependencies clearly marked
3. **Validation Checkpoints**: Specific points where validation will occur
4. **Risk Assessment Summary**: Key risks identified and mitigation strategies
5. **Resource Requirements**: Time estimates and agent assignments
6. **Success Criteria**: Clear definition of what constitutes successful completion

### Planning Approval

- **User Confirmation**: Present planning output to user for approval before proceeding
- **Plan Modification**: Allow user to request changes to the plan
- **Final Approval**: Obtain explicit user approval before moving to implementation
- **Plan Documentation**: Store approved plan for future reference

### 1.4 Backup & Restore Points

### State Snapshots

- Create system state snapshot before any changes
- Tag snapshots with unique identifiers and timestamps
- Ensure clean state before proceeding

### Update Identification

- **Codename**: Generate unique codename for each self-update operation
- **Timestamp**: Include precise timestamp for tracking
- **Log Organisation**: All logs for this update stored under codename + timestamp

### Restore Strategy

- **Trigger**: Any failure in update pipeline
- **Method**: Restore to last known good state
- **Scope**: Revert all changes and reset to snapshot

### 1.5 Update Execution Pipeline

### Queue Management

- **Concurrent Requests**: Add to sequential queue
- **Queue Blocking**: Prevent new processing during active update
- **Failure Handling**: Clear entire queue on any failure, report individual status

### Execution Phases

1. **Initiation**: Processing acknowledgment
2. **Planning Phase**: Analysis and plan creation
3. **Plan Presentation**: Present detailed plan to user for approval
4. **Git Snapshot**: Create safety backup before changes
5. **Implementation**: Claude applies changes to working directory
6. **Pre-Restart Validation**: Validate changes before system restart
7. **System Restart**: Apply validated changes to live system
8. **Post-Restart Validation**: Verify system health
9. **Git Operations**: Commit and push validated changes
10. **System Lock**: Maintained throughout to prevent corruption

### Change Implementation

- Follow approved implementation plan step-by-step
- Apply modifications according to planned sequence
- **Two-Phase Validation**: Execute validation before and after key milestones
- **Quality Gates**: Proceed only after validation steps pass
- **Change Tracking**: Maintain complete audit trail
- Preserve system history for accountability

### 1.6 Two-Phase Validation Pipeline

### Phase 1: Engineering Review

**Objective**: Like engineers reviewing all the work - validate changes BEFORE restarting the live system

**Note**: At this stage, Claude has already modified files in the working directory. Validation ensures these changes are safe before the system restarts with the new code.

#### Engineering Review Parts

- Part 1: Code Standards Review - Architecture and patterns inspection
- Part 2: Test Coverage Analysis - Critical path verification
- Part 3: Security Inspection - Vulnerability assessment
- Part 4: Integration Review - System cohesion check

#### Engineering Review Gate

- **Requirement**: ALL Engineering Review parts must pass
- **Action on Failure**: Rollback changes to snapshot; do NOT restart system
- **Action on Success**: Proceed to Final Assembly Checklist

### Phase 2: Final Assembly Checklist

**Objective**: Like ticking boxes before the car rolls off the line - mechanical verification

#### Assembly Line Checks

- Part 1: ✓ Compilation Check - Verify system compiles
- Part 2: ✓ Test Execution - Run all tests
- Part 3: ✓ Formatting Check - Ensure code style compliance  
- Part 4: ✓ Linting Check - Verify code quality standards
- Part 5: ✓ Documentation Build - Confirm docs generate

#### Final Assembly Gate

- **Requirement**: ALL checklist items must pass
- **Action on Failure**: Loop back to Engineering Review (max 3 iterations)
- **Action on Success**: Proceed to system restart

### Post-Restart Validation

After system restart, the same two-phase validation runs again to verify the live system.

### Timeout Handling

- **Operation Timeout**: Retry operation and update progress
- **Extended Timeout**: Implement backoff strategy with status updates
- **Maximum Retries**: Define limit before marking as failed
- **Phase-Specific Timeouts**: Track timeouts separately for each validation phase

### 1.7 Success/Failure Handling

### Success Path

1. **Pre-restart Notification**: System restart announcement
2. **System Shutdown**: Terminate existing processes
3. **System Startup**: Initialise new system instance
4. **Post-Restart Validation**: Verify system health with new code
5. **Git Commit**: Commit validated changes with descriptive message
6. **Git Push**: Push changes to remote repository
7. **Completion Notification**: System back online confirmation
8. **Change Report**: Detailed summary of modifications and validations passed

### Failure Path
