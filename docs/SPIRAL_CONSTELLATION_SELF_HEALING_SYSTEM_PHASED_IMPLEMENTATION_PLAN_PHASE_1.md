## Phase 1: Core Self-Healing Foundation

### Goals

- Establish reliable self-update pipeline
- Prove safety mechanisms work
- Build operational confidence
- Collect baseline performance data

### 1.1 Trigger Conditions

### Authorised Activation

- **Who**: Pre-defined authorised users (system already handles this)
- **How**: Direct mention of @Spiral Constellation#4975 by authorised user with update request
- **Alternative**: Wrench auto-fix for specific messages (authorised users only)

### Unauthorised Access Handling

- **Response**: Use Claude to generate a unique Lordgenome-style despair quote relating to the user's specific action (Gurren Lagann reference)
- **Action**: Deny request and provide the contextual quote as response

### 1.2 Pre-flight Checks

### System State Validation

- Verify system isn't currently in update mode
- Check if update queue has available slots
- Ensure system has booted without errors
- Validate all current tests are passing

### Resource Availability

- Confirm sufficient disk space for git operations
- Verify 8GB RAM limit compliance
- Check Claude API connectivity
- Ensure Discord bot connection is stable

### Information Gathering

- Determine if additional information is needed from requesting user
- If insufficient information: Reply to user's message requesting specifics
- **Restart Process**: Restart the entire process with the combined original + response messages

### 1.3 Backup & Restore Points

### Git-Based Snapshots

- Create git commit with current system state before any changes
- Tag commit as "pre-update-snapshot-[codename]-[timestamp]"
- Ensure clean working directory before proceeding

### Update Identification

- **Codename**: Generate unique codename for each self-update operation
- **Timestamp**: Include precise timestamp for tracking
- **Log Organisation**: All logs for this update stored under codename + timestamp

### Restore Strategy

- **Trigger**: Any failure in update pipeline
- **Method**: Hard reset to last known good commit (if snapshot available)
- **Scope**: Revert all uncommitted changes and reset to snapshot (if snapshot is available)

### 1.4 Update Execution Pipeline

### Queue Management

- **Concurrent Requests**: Add to sequential queue
- **Queue Blocking**: Prevent new self-update message processing during active update
- **Failure Handling**: Clear entire queue on any failure, report individual status

### Execution Phases

1. **Initiation Message**: "Processing self-update request..." (in same channel)
2. **Update Start**: "Starting self-update [codename]..."
3. **Progress Updates**: "Updating main Spiral Core..." (with periodic status updates indicating current phase: testing, auditing, code review, etc.)
4. **System Lock**: Implement update lock mechanism to prevent corruption

### Change Implementation

- Apply requested modifications to system files
- **Pre-commit Validation**: Execute entire validation pipeline BEFORE committing changes
- Commit changes only after all validation steps pass
- **Push Changes**: Push git commits to remote repository
- Maintain git history for accountability

### 1.5 Two-Phase Validation Pipeline

### Pipeline Architecture

**Flow Logic**: Phase 1 (AQA) ‚Üí Phase 2 (CRCC) ‚Üí Success/Failure Analysis

- If ANY Phase 2 check requires retry, loop back to Phase 1
- Maximum 3 complete pipeline iterations before failure

### Phase 1: Advanced Quality Assurance (AQA)

Execute sequentially with max 3 retries per check:

1. **Code Review & Standards Compliance**

   - **Claude Prompt**: "Perform comprehensive code review against project standards. Verify architectural consistency, naming conventions, error handling patterns, and adherence to established codebase guidelines."
   - **Success**: Full compliance with coding standards

2. **Comprehensive Testing Analysis**

   - **Claude Prompt**: "Perform comprehensive testing analysis focused on pressure points and critical failure scenarios. Implement ONLY high-value test cases for edge cases that could cause system failure."
   - **Success**: Zero test failures, critical scenarios covered

3. **Security Audit**

   - **Claude Prompt**: "Conduct thorough security audit. Identify potential vulnerabilities, unsafe code patterns, dependency security issues, and data validation gaps."
   - **Success**: Zero critical vulnerabilities

4. **System Integration Verification**
   - **Claude Prompt**: "Verify system integration integrity. Test that changes don't break existing functionality, APIs remain compatible, and all integration points function correctly."
   - **Success**: No integration regressions

### Phase 2: Core Rust Compliance Checks (CRCC)

Execute sequentially - ANY retry triggers return to Phase 1:

1. **Compilation Verification** (`cargo check`)

   - **Failure Action**: Spawn Claude with "Fix all compilation errors identified by cargo check"
   - **Loop Trigger**: Any retry ‚Üí Phase 1

2. **Test Suite Validation** (`cargo test`)

   - **Failure Action**: Spawn Claude with "Analyse and fix failing tests. DO NOT delete tests unless fundamentally invalid"
   - **Loop Trigger**: Any retry ‚Üí Phase 1

3. **Code Formatting** (`cargo fmt`)

   - **Failure Action**: Spawn Claude with "Apply Rust standard formatting using cargo fmt"
   - **Loop Trigger**: Any retry ‚Üí Phase 1

4. **Linting Compliance** (`cargo clippy`)

   - **Failure Action**: Spawn Claude with "Fix all Clippy warnings and errors"
   - **Loop Trigger**: Any retry ‚Üí Phase 1

5. **Documentation Generation** (`cargo doc`)
   - **Failure Action**: Spawn Claude with "Fix documentation build errors"
   - **Loop Trigger**: Any retry ‚Üí Phase 1

### Timeout Handling

- **Claude Timeout**: Immediate retry with progress update
- **Extended Timeout**: Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
- **Maximum Timeout Retries**: 3 attempts before escalation

### Analysis Protocols

**Success Analysis** (No Phase 2 retries):

- Spawn Claude: "Generate success report including checks performed, code quality metrics, security findings, test coverage, and deployment checklist"

**Success with Issues Analysis** (Phase 2 retries but passed):

- Spawn Claude: "Analyze which compliance checks required retries, identify systemic problems, recommend process improvements"

**Failure Analysis** (3 iterations exhausted):

- Spawn Claude: "CRITICAL FAILURE ANALYSIS: Identify root causes, determine if failures are due to prompts/code/tools/criteria. Propose pipeline modifications"

### 1.6 Success/Failure Handling

### Success Path

1. **Pre-restart Message**: "Restarting Spiral Core..."
2. **Server Shutdown**: Kill existing server process
3. **Server Startup**: Initialise new server instance
4. **Completion Message**: "Spiral Core Back online"
5. **Change Report**: Detailed summary of modifications and tests passed

### Failure Path

1. **Problem Analysis**: Execute failure analysis protocol using generated logs
2. **Immediate Rollback**: Revert to pre-update snapshot
3. **System Restart**: Reboot to last known good state (if the server got shut down)
4. **Failure Report**: Comprehensive analysis of what succeeded/failed
5. **Queue Cleanup**: Mark all queued requests with failure status
6. **Retry Mechanism**: Add retry emoji ‚ôªÔ∏è to failed requests for user retry

### Queue Status Reporting

- **Individual Status**: Separate messages for each queued request outcome
- **Success**: ‚úÖ "Update [codename] completed successfully"
- **Failure**: ‚ùå "Update [codename] failed - [reason]" with retry emoji ‚ôªÔ∏è
- **Retry Functionality**: Clicking retry emoji ‚ôªÔ∏è re-adds request to queue with new codename

### 1.7 Post-Update Monitoring

### Health Validation

- **System Boot**: Verify server starts without errors
- **Test Suite**: Confirm all tests pass post-restart
- **Service Connectivity**: Validate Discord bot and Claude API connections
- **Performance**: Monitor within 8GB RAM constraints

### Logging & Documentation

- **Structured Logs**: Maintain detailed update logs organised by codename + timestamp
- **Change Tracking**: Git history provides complete audit trail
- **Issue Analysis**: Log all encountered problems under codename for failure analysis
- **Success Metrics**: Track successful update patterns by codename

### Continuous Monitoring

- **Ongoing Health**: Monitor system stability post-update
- **Performance Validation**: Ensure update didn't degrade performance
- **User Feedback**: Track any reported issues from authorised users

### 1.8 Communication Protocols

### Message Templates

- **Processing**: "üîÑ Processing self-update request..."
- **Starting**: "üöÄ Starting self-update [codename]..."
- **Working**: "‚öôÔ∏è Updating main Spiral Core... [current phase]"
- **Restarting**: "üîÑ Restarting Spiral Core..."
- **Success**: "‚úÖ Spiral Core Back online [codename]"
- **Failure**: "‚ùå Update [codename] failed: [specific reason] ‚ôªÔ∏è"
