## Phase 1: Core Self-Healing Foundation

### Goals

- Establish reliable self-update pipeline
- Prove safety mechanisms work
- Build operational confidence
- Collect baseline performance data

### 1.1 Trigger Conditions

### Authorised Activation

- **Who**: Pre-defined authorised users (system already handles this)
- **How**: Direct mention of @Spiral Constellation#4975 by authorised user with update request
- **Alternative**: Wrench auto-fix for specific messages (authorised users only)

### Unauthorised Access Handling

- **Response**: Use Claude to generate a unique Lordgenome-style despair quote relating to the user's specific action (Gurren Lagann reference)
- **Action**: Deny request and provide the contextual quote as response

### 1.2 Pre-flight Checks

### System State Validation

- Verify system isn't currently in update mode
- Check if update queue has available slots
- Ensure system has booted without errors
- Validate all current tests are passing

### Resource Availability

- Confirm sufficient disk space for git operations
- Verify 8GB RAM limit compliance
- Check Claude API connectivity
- Ensure Discord bot connection is stable

### Information Gathering

- Determine if additional information is needed from requesting user
- If insufficient information: Reply to user's message requesting specifics
- **Restart Process**: Restart the entire process with the combined original + response messages

### 1.3 Backup & Restore Points

### Git-Based Snapshots

- Create git commit with current system state before any changes
- Tag commit as "pre-update-snapshot-[codename]-[timestamp]"
- Ensure clean working directory before proceeding

### Update Identification

- **Codename**: Generate unique codename for each self-update operation
- **Timestamp**: Include precise timestamp for tracking
- **Log Organisation**: All logs for this update stored under codename + timestamp

### Restore Strategy

- **Trigger**: Any failure in update pipeline
- **Method**: Hard reset to last known good commit (if snapshot available)
- **Scope**: Revert all uncommitted changes and reset to snapshot (if snapshot is available)

### 1.4 Update Execution Pipeline

### Queue Management

- **Concurrent Requests**: Add to sequential queue
- **Queue Blocking**: Prevent new self-update message processing during active update
- **Failure Handling**: Clear entire queue on any failure, report individual status

### Execution Phases

1. **Initiation Message**: "Processing self-update request..." (in same channel)
2. **Update Start**: "Starting self-update [codename]..."
3. **Progress Updates**: "Updating main Spiral Core..." (with periodic status updates indicating current phase: testing, auditing, code review, etc.)
4. **System Lock**: Implement update lock mechanism to prevent corruption

### Change Implementation

- Apply requested modifications to system files
- **Pre-commit Validation**: Execute entire validation pipeline BEFORE committing changes
- Commit changes only after all validation steps pass
- **Push Changes**: Push git commits to remote repository
- Maintain git history for accountability

### 1.5 Validation Pipeline

### Testing Requirements

- **Standard**: Run comprehensive testing validation
- **Execution**: Claude runs test commands (automated testing)
- **Threshold**: Zero test failures accepted
- **Failure Response**: Do NOT aggressively delete failing tests; investigate and fix

### Audit Procedures

1. **Testing**: Run comprehensive testing validation
2. **Security Audit**: Perform security vulnerability analysis
3. **Code Review**: Execute comprehensive code review
4. **System Integration**: Verify changes don't break existing functionality

### Timeout Handling

- **Claude Timeout**: Retry operation and update progress message
- **Extended Timeout**: Implement exponential backoff with status updates
- **Maximum Retries**: Define limit before marking as failed

### 1.6 Success/Failure Handling

### Success Path

1. **Pre-restart Message**: "Restarting Spiral Core..."
2. **Server Shutdown**: Kill existing server process
3. **Server Startup**: Initialise new server instance
4. **Completion Message**: "Spiral Core Back online"
5. **Change Report**: Detailed summary of modifications and tests passed

### Failure Path

1. **Problem Analysis**: Analyze issues using generated logs
2. **Immediate Rollback**: Revert to pre-update snapshot
3. **System Restart**: Reboot to last known good state (if the server got shut down)
4. **Failure Report**: Comprehensive analysis of what succeeded/failed (include Coach Iroh's analysis)
5. **Queue Cleanup**: Mark all queued requests with failure status
6. **Retry Mechanism**: Add retry emoji ‚ôªÔ∏è to failed requests for user retry

### Queue Status Reporting

- **Individual Status**: Separate messages for each queued request outcome
- **Success**: ‚úÖ "Update [codename] completed successfully"
- **Failure**: ‚ùå "Update [codename] failed - [reason]" with retry emoji ‚ôªÔ∏è
- **Retry Functionality**: Clicking retry emoji ‚ôªÔ∏è re-adds request to queue with new codename

### 1.7 Post-Update Monitoring

### Health Validation

- **System Boot**: Verify server starts without errors
- **Test Suite**: Confirm all tests pass post-restart
- **Service Connectivity**: Validate Discord bot and Claude API connections
- **Performance**: Monitor within 8GB RAM constraints

### Logging & Documentation

- **Structured Logs**: Maintain detailed update logs organised by codename + timestamp
- **Change Tracking**: Git history provides complete audit trail
- **Issue Analysis**: Log all encountered problems under codename for Coach Iroh analysis
- **Success Metrics**: Track successful update patterns by codename

### Continuous Monitoring

- **Ongoing Health**: Monitor system stability post-update
- **Performance Validation**: Ensure update didn't degrade performance
- **User Feedback**: Track any reported issues from authorised users

### 1.8 Communication Protocols

### Message Templates

- **Processing**: "üîÑ Processing self-update request..."
- **Starting**: "üöÄ Starting self-update [codename]..."
- **Working**: "‚öôÔ∏è Updating main Spiral Core... [current phase]"
- **Restarting**: "üîÑ Restarting Spiral Core..."
- **Success**: "‚úÖ Spiral Core Back online [codename]"
- **Failure**: "‚ùå Update [codename] failed: [specific reason] ‚ôªÔ∏è"

### Phase 1 Success Criteria

- [ ] 10+ successful simple updates (messages, comments, minor fixes)
- [ ] 3+ successful test additions/modifications
- [ ] 1+ successful feature addition
- [ ] Zero data loss incidents
- [ ] All validation agents working reliably
- [ ] Queue system handling concurrent requests properly
- [ ] Rollback mechanism tested and working
