# Spiral Core: Foundation & Naming Guidelines

## Overview

**Spiral Core** is the foundational system developed by Anti Spiral Interactive. It serves as the intelligent engine orchestrating a suite of interconnected modules designed to manage complexity with clarity and precision. Inspired by the vastness and order of space, the system embodies balance between expansive reach and focused control.

This document provides the guiding principles for naming conventions and the thematic framework that underpins all components created within the Spiral Core ecosystem.

---

## Purpose

- Establish a consistent, scalable naming convention for all system components.
- Reflect the system’s identity, combining cosmic inspiration with technological sophistication.
- Ensure clear communication internally and externally through meaningful, evocative names.
- Support brand cohesion across documentation, development, and marketing.

## Naming Conventions

All names within the Spiral Core ecosystem begin with the prefix **“Spiral”** followed by a carefully selected cosmic or space-inspired term that reflects the component’s role and nature.

| Name                     | Description                                                          |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Spiral Core**          | The central intelligence and control hub of the system.              |
| **Spiral Celestial**     | Modules or features representing broad scope or high-level overview. |
| **Spiral Constellation** | Components that manage connections, patterns, or orchestration.      |
| **Spiral Cosmos**        | Elements with wide-reaching influence or scope across the system.    |
| **Spiral Comet**         | Fast-moving or event-driven processes and tasks.                     |
| **Spiral Cluster**       | Aggregation points or groups of data and resources.                  |
| **Spiral Continuum**     | Continuous processes or workflows, representing flow over time.      |
| **Spiral Crux**          | Critical decision points or pivotal system components.               |
| **Spiral Cyclone**       | Modules handling dynamic load, scaling, or resource management.      |

## Usage Guidelines

- **Consistency**: Always use the prefix **“Spiral”** for all core system components, modules, and features to maintain clear brand identity.
- **Clarity**: Choose the suffix based on the component’s primary function or characteristic, guided by the descriptions above.
- **Documentation**: Use these names in all technical documents, architecture diagrams, API naming, and communications.
- **Extensibility**: New components should follow the same naming pattern, selecting space-inspired terms that fit the component’s purpose.

## Brand and Thematic Notes

- The **“Spiral”** prefix symbolizes growth, evolution, and the elegant complexity of natural systems.
- Cosmic and astronomical terms evoke the vastness and interconnectedness inherent in the system’s design.
- Names should balance imaginative resonance with technical clarity to support both creativity and practical communication.
