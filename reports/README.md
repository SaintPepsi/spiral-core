# Analysis Reports

This directory contains automated analysis reports generated by post-commit hooks.

Reports are READ-ONLY analyses - the agents never modify code, only generate reports.

## Report Types

- **code-quality-report.md** - Code quality metrics and violations
- **security-audit-report.md** - Security vulnerability scans  
- **performance-analysis-report.md** - Performance concerns and optimizations

## Generation

Reports are automatically generated after each commit using `make analyze` or via post-commit hooks.

To skip analysis for a commit:

```bash
SKIP_POST_COMMIT_ANALYSIS=1 git commit -m "message"
```
