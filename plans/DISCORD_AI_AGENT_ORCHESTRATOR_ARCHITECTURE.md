**Discord AI Agent Orchestrator Architecture Overview:**

The system will consist of two main parts:

1. **Discord Bot Service (Node.js / TypeScript):**

   - Runs continuously, listening for messages/events on one or more Discord servers.
   - Uses `discord.js` library and WebSockets to communicate with Discord's API in real-time.

2. **AI Agent Orchestrator Backend (Rust):**
   - A separate service running your Rust code.
   - Exposes an HTTP API (REST or gRPC, but REST is simpler for this plan) for the Discord bot to
     interact with.
   - Contains the core logic of managing and interacting with your AI agents.

**Communication Flow:**

- The Discord Bot receives a user message/command in a designated channel.
- The Bot processes this input locally if necessary (e.g., basic validation, formatting).
- The Bot sends a structured request over HTTP to specific endpoints on the Rust backend server.
- The Rust backend executes logic involving your AI agents and returns a result.
- The Rust backend might also send data or notifications back via WebSockets if needed for real-time
  updates _to the Discord bot_, but typically, you'll just return results upon polling.

```

**Detailed Components:**

**(1) Discord Bot Service Layer**

- **Node.js Runtime:** Uses a version compatible with `discord.js`.
- **TypeScript:** Used for type safety and code clarity.
- **`discord.js` Library:** Core dependency for interacting with Discord's API via WebSockets, REST,
  and gateway events. Choose either `@discordjs/bot` (modern) or the standard `discord.js` (`v14`, `v13`,
  etc.) based on your needs and Discord's version requirements.
  - **Functionality:**
    _ Creates a client instance connected to one or more Discord servers (guilds).
    _ Listens for specific messages, commands, interactions (slash commands), or events (like
    reactions). \* Has command/interaction handlers that perform actions based on the detected input. These handlers
    will often contain code to send a request to your Rust backend.
  - **Modules:**
    _ `config.ts`: Handles Discord bot token and server IDs.
    _ `client.ts` (`discord.js v14+` structure): Main entry point, initializes the client, sets up
    event listeners (e.g., messageCreate).
    _ `commands/register.ts`: Defines slash commands or other interactions for users. This registers
    these with Discord.
    _ `handlers/message.ts`: Processes incoming messages and determines how to route them. \* `api-client.ts`: A module defining functions (`fetch`) that the bot uses to call the Rust
    backend's HTTP API.

**(2) AI Agent Orchestrator Backend Layer**

- **Rust Runtime:** Used as a system service. Needs appropriate dependencies for async (like
  `async-std` or `tokio`), web server, and JSON parsing.

  - **Functionality:**
    _ Runs independently on its own port/server machine.
    _ Exposes HTTP endpoints via a web framework (e.g., `warp`, `actix-web`, `hyper`). `warp` is often
    concise for REST APIs in Rust using Tokio async. \* Manages the state and interaction logic of your AI agents. This is where your core Rust agent
    code resides.

  - **Modules:**
    _ `config.rs`: Reads configuration (e.g., bot API URL, port).
    _ `api/mod.rs`: Contains the router/endpoints for the HTTP service.
    _ `routes/agent.rs`: Handles commands/query related to specific agents (GET status, RUN action).
    This might call your agent logic modules.
    _ `routes/orchestration.rs`: Handles higher-level orchestration tasks if needed (e.g., deploy new
    instance).
    _ `services/agent_service.rs`: Manages the state and execution context for each type of AI agent.
    Coordinates interactions between different agents or with external systems.
    _ `models/**/*.rs`: Defines data structures representing your agents, their states, messages, etc.

**(3) Integration Layer (Bot <-> Backend)**

- This is handled by defining HTTP endpoints on the Rust backend that the Discord bot can call using
  its API-client module. The requests are formatted in JSON or another agreed-upon way to carry data
  relevant for triggering agent actions or querying state.

**Example Interaction Scenario:**

1. User types a message: `!agent do_something`.
2. `Discord Bot Service`:
   - Parses the command (`!agent`) and parameter (`do_something`).
   - Looks up information about agents (maybe hardcoded for now, maybe queried from backend later).
     Finds an agent named "TaskBot".
   - Serializes a request: `{ "agent_name": "TaskBot", "action": "do_something" }`.
   - Uses `api-client.ts` to send this JSON data via HTTP POST to the Rust backend's specific endpoint
     (e.g., `/api/agents/run-command`).
3. `AI Agent Orchestrator Backend`:
   - The web framework (`warp`) routes the request.
   - A handler function in `routes/agent.rs` receives it, validates the action name and agent name
     against known configurations (maybe via a database later), then dispatches this to the appropriate Rust
     module containing your "TaskBot" agent logic.
   - Your Rust agent code executes the requested action (`do_something`). It might change its internal
     state or need external help from other agents. This is managed by `services/agent_service.rs` and/or
     your core orchestrator logic modules.
4. The backend sends an HTTP response back to the bot, containing results (e.g., `{ "status": 
"success", "result": "...the outcome..." }`) or errors.

**Key Considerations:**

- **Authentication:** Decide how the bot will authenticate its requests to the Rust backend. Simple
  could be a shared secret key in headers. More secure might involve tokens or even mutual TLS (mTLS).
  This prevents unauthorized access.
- **Data Format:** Use JSON for request and response payloads as it's standard, human-readable, and
  well-supported by libraries in both Node.js (`JSON.parse`, `JSON.stringify`) and Rust (`serde`).
- **Error Handling:**
  - The bot should handle network errors (e.g., backend down), invalid responses from the backend, and
    API timeouts gracefully. Maybe retry logic or fallback behaviors.
  - The backend should validate all incoming requests and return clear error messages if something goes
    wrong.
- **Synchronous vs Asynchronous:** Be mindful that HTTP calls are asynchronous operations for the bot,
  so it shouldn't block the Discord WebSocket connection waiting for a response unless using WebSockets.
  This means the user will typically not see immediate feedback from the backend execution within
  Discord, as commands take time to process in Rust.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on both sides (Discord API side and your own backend) to
  prevent abuse or overloading the system.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Set up a dedicated server for the Rust backend if it's not already running separately. Ensure
   firewalls allow traffic from the bot's IP address.
2. Write the `discord.js`/TS bot code first, focusing on connecting to Discord and handling basic
   events/commands (maybe initially simple echo commands). Test connectivity.
3. Build your HTTP API client module (`api-client.ts`) with a placeholder function that just returns `{ 
"message": "Request received" }`. Then test sending this from the bot handler to see if it works
   locally.
4. Develop the core logic for one of your simplest agents in Rust within the backend, ensuring it's
   properly structured and can be called via an HTTP endpoint (e.g., `warp` route).
5. Implement the corresponding HTTP endpoint on the Rust backend (`/api/agents/run-command`) that calls
   this agent code.
6. Modify the bot to actually call this endpoint when a specific command is detected, passing
   appropriate data.
7. Refine the Rust backend: Split your existing Rust agents into modular units (state management,
   stateless logic) and connect them via `services` or direct controller functions.

This architecture keeps the Discord interface separate from the core AI logic. It allows you to build
features incrementally â€“ start with basic commands interacting with a simple backend API, then enrich
the agent capabilities later without changing the bot's core structure much (just the data it
sends/interprets). Remember to test thoroughly for reliability and robustness!
