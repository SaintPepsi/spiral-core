- **Iterative Refinement**: Progressive improvement through feedback loops

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Request Analysis

1. Parse user requirements and extract core functionality needs
2. Detect programming language from context (file paths, project type, content)
3. Identify appropriate frameworks, libraries, and architectural patterns
4. Build enriched context with technical specifications and constraints

### Phase 2: Code Generation Strategy

1. Construct optimized Claude Code generation requests
2. Include relevant project context, existing code, and requirements
3. Specify language-specific best practices and conventions
4. Set quality criteria and validation requirements

### Phase 3: Implementation

1. Generate code through Claude Code with enhanced context
2. Validate syntax, semantics, and security compliance
3. Ensure comprehensive test coverage and documentation
4. Apply framework-specific optimizations and patterns

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance

1. **Syntactic Validation**: Code compiles and follows language rules
2. **Semantic Analysis**: Logic correctness and error handling
3. **Security Review**: No vulnerabilities or unsafe patterns
4. **Best Practice Compliance**: Follows established coding standards
5. **Integration Testing**: Works correctly with existing systems

## Quality Standards
