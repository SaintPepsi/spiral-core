//! ðŸ”„ SELF UPDATE TYPES: Core data structures for update system
//!
//! This module defines the fundamental types used throughout the self-update system.
//! All types are designed to be serializable for persistence and network transmission.

use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

/// Represents a request to update the system through Claude Code
///
/// Each request captures all necessary context from the Discord conversation,
/// including the user's intent, authorization details, and tracking information.
///
/// # Security Considerations
///
/// - `codename` is sanitized before use in git operations
/// - `description` and `combined_messages` are validated for size limits
/// - `user_id` must be in the authorized users list
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
